Project to help bootstrap playing around with eBPF, adapted from the kernel's sample programs.

However, these programs stand alone and do not require the kernel sources to work.

As a first step, run make and experiment with the binaries.

Dependencies:

gcc
clang (>= 3.8)
llc (llvm must support BPF target)
libelf-dev
make :-)
